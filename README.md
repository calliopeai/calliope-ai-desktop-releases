## Downloads

### Latest Releases

> **⚠️ Note: Code Signing In Progress**
>
> We are currently in the process of signing our builds. Until signing is complete, you may see security warnings on macOS and Windows. This is normal for new software awaiting certification. See the [macOS Security Guide](#macos-security-guide) below for detailed instructions.

Downloads are available on the [Releases](../../releases) page.

### Installation Instructions

#### macOS
1. Download the appropriate `.zip` file for your architecture:
   - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**: Download the ARM64 version
   - **Intel Mac**: Download the x64 version
   - **Universal**: Works on both (larger file size)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Drag the application to your Applications folder
4. **First launch requires security approval** — See [macOS Security Guide](#macos-security-guide) below

#### Windows
1. Download the `.exe` installer or `.zip` portable version
2. Run the installer or extract the portable version
3. If SmartScreen appears, click "More info" → "Run anyway"
4. Follow the installation wizard

**PowerShell Alternative (Advanced Users):**
```powershell
# Remove the "downloaded from internet" marker
Unblock-File -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Calliope AI IDE Setup.exe"
```

#### Linux
**DEB (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i calliope-*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix dependencies if needed
```

**RPM (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS):**
```bash
sudo rpm -i calliope-*.rpm
```

**AppImage:**
```bash
chmod +x Calliope-*.AppImage
./Calliope-*.AppImage
```

**TAR.GZ:**
```bash
tar -xzf calliope-*.tar.gz
cd calliope-*
./calliope-ide  # or ./calliope-lab
```

## macOS Security Guide

While our code signing is being finalized, macOS will show several security prompts when you first launch Calliope apps. **This is expected behavior** for apps not yet registered with Apple. Here's what to expect and how to proceed:

### Step 1: Open via System Settings

When you first try to open the app, macOS will block it. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and scroll down to see the blocked app notice. Click **"Open Anyway"**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/ide/open-anyway.png" alt="System Settings Security" width="500"/>
</p>

### Step 2: Confirm in Gatekeeper Dialog

A dialog will appear asking you to confirm. Click **"Open Anyway"** to proceed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/ide/gatekeeper-dialog.png" alt="Gatekeeper Dialog" width="350"/>
</p>

### Step 3: Authenticate with Touch ID or Password

macOS will ask for administrator authentication (Touch ID or password) to confirm you want to open the app.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/ide/privacy-auth.png" alt="Privacy Authentication" width="350"/>
</p>

### Step 4: Allow Keychain Access (for API Key Storage)

Calliope apps securely store your API keys in your macOS Keychain. When prompted, enter your login keychain password and click **"Always Allow"** to grant permanent access.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/ide/keychain-access.png" alt="Keychain Access" width="500"/>
</p>

> **Why Keychain?** Your API keys are encrypted and stored in Apple's secure Keychain, the same system that protects your passwords and certificates. This ensures your credentials are never stored in plain text.

### Step 5: Allow App Data Access (Optional)

You may see a prompt asking to allow the app to access data from other apps. Click **"Allow"** if you want features like browser integration.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/ide/app-data-access.png" alt="App Data Access" width="350"/>
</p>

### After Initial Setup

Once you've completed these steps, the app will open normally on subsequent launches. You only need to go through this process once per app.

### Terminal Alternative (Advanced Users)

If you prefer the command line, you can remove the quarantine attribute directly:

```bash
# For Calliope AI IDE
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Calliope\ AI\ IDE.app

# For Calliope AI Lab
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Calliope\ AI\ Lab.app
```

This removes the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute that macOS adds to downloaded files, bypassing Gatekeeper warnings. The `-r` flag applies recursively to all files within the app bundle.

> **Note:** You'll still be prompted for Keychain access on first launch (Step 4 above).

### Calliope AI Lab - Additional Permissions

Calliope AI Lab follows the same security approval process as the IDE. You may also see prompts for folder access (e.g., Desktop, Documents) when working with local data files. Click **"Allow"** to enable data analysis on files in those locations.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/security/lab/folder-access.png" alt="Folder Access" width="350"/>
</p>

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to create an account?</b></summary>
No. Download, install, and start working. No signup, no login, no account required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is there a catch? How is this free?</b></summary>
The desktop apps are genuinely free. We make money from our cloud platform and enterprise offerings. The desktop apps are a way to let developers and data scientists experience Calliope with zero friction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What do I need to use AI features?</b></summary>
API keys from your preferred AI provider(s). You pay them directly at their standard rates — we don't mark up or proxy your API calls.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this completely offline?</b></summary>
Yes! Core editing/notebook features work offline. For AI features, you can run <a href="https://ollama.ai">Ollama</a> locally for fully offline AI.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is my data sent anywhere?</b></summary>
Your data stays on your machine. When you use AI features, your prompts go directly to your chosen AI provider — not through our servers.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I see security warnings on macOS?</b></summary>
We are currently in the process of getting our builds signed with Apple. Until that's complete, macOS Gatekeeper will show warnings for unverified developers. This is normal — see our <a href="#macos-security-guide">macOS Security Guide</a> for step-by-step instructions to open the app safely.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why does the app ask for Keychain access?</b></summary>
Your API keys are stored securely in the macOS Keychain (Apple's encrypted credential storage). This is far more secure than storing keys in plain text config files. Click "Always Allow" to grant permanent access.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why should I use this instead of Cursor/Copilot?</b></summary>
Freedom. Use any AI provider (or multiple), switch anytime, pay API rates instead of subscriptions, work offline, no vendor lock-in.
</details>
